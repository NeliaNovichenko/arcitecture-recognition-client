# Architecture Recognition Client

![N|Solid](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6582119?s=280&v=4 ) 

Frontend application for architectural styles predictions of buildings by images.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Make sure you have [arcitecture-prediction-api](https://github.com/NeliaNovichenko/arcitecture-prediction-api) running and listening on port 5000 and [arcitecture-prediction-api](https://github.com/NeliaNovichenko/arcitecture-recognition-api) on port 44357.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Technical task:
 - User is able to create an account in system
 - User is able to sign in
 - User is able to upload image of building
 - User is able to review results of architectural style prediction
 - User is able to save result of prediction
 - User is able to review saved results
 - User is able to sort saved results by name, date, architectural style
 - User is able to read description of availiable architectural styles

## Ways to develop project:
  - adapt project for mobile using
  - object detection: detect building on photos and predict architectural styles for them 
  - fix performance
